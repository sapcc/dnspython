A Note on Typing
----------------

Dnspython has partial support for type annotations in separate .pyi
files.  Type information will not be integrated into the main files
until major LTS versions of various Linux distributions containing 3.6
are beyond their support times.  Improvements to the .pyi files are
welcome during this time.
