What's New in dnspython
=======================

2.2.0 (in development)
----------------------

* SVCB and HTTPS records have been updated to track the evolving draft
  standard.

* The ZONEMD type has been added.

* The resolver now returns a LifetimeTimeout exception which includes
  an error trace like the NoNameservers exception.  This class is a subclass of
  dns.exception.Timeout for backwards compatibility.

2.1.0
----------------------

* End-of-line comments are now associated with rdata when read from text.
  For backwards compatibility with prior versions of dnspython, they are
  only emitted in to_text() when requested.

* Synchronous I/O is a bit more efficient, as we now try the I/O and only
  use poll() or select() if the I/O would block.

* The resolver cache classes now offer basic hit and miss statistics, and
  the LRUCache can also provide hits for every cache key.

* The resolver has a canonical_name() method.

* There is now a registration mechanism for EDNS option types.

* The default EDNS payload size has changed from 1280 to 1232.

* The SVCB, HTTPS, and SMIMEA RR types are now supported.

* TSIG has been enhanced with TKEY and GSS-TSIG support.  Thanks to
  Nick Hall for writing this.

* Zones now can be updated via transactions.

* A new zone subclass, dns.versioned.Zone is available which has a
  thread-safe transaction implementation and support for keeping many
  versions of a zone.

* The zone file reading code has been adapted to use transactions, and
  is now a public API.

* Inbound zone transfer support has been rewritten and is available as
  dns.query.inbound_xfr() and dns.asyncquery.inbound_xfr().  It uses
  the transaction mechanism, and fully supports IXFR and AXFR.

2.0.0
-----

* Python 3.6 or newer is required.

* The license is now the ISC license.

* Rdata is now immutable.  Use ``dns.rdata.Rdata.replace()`` to make a new
  Rdata based on an existing one.

* dns.resolver.resolve() has been added, allowing control of whether search
  lists are used.  dns.resolver.query() is retained for
  backwards compatibility, but deprecated.  The default for search list
  behavior can be set at in the resolver object with the
  ``use_search_by_default`` parameter.  The default is False.

* DNS-over-TLS is supported with ``dns.query.tls()``.

* DNS-over-HTTPS is supported with ``dns.query.https()``, and the resolver
  will use DNS-over-HTTPS for a nameserver which is an HTTPS URL.

* Basic query and resolver support for the Trio, Curio, and asyncio
  asynchronous I/O libraries has been added in ``dns.asyncquery`` and
  ``dns.asyncresolver``.  This API should be viewed as experimental as
  asynchronous I/O support in dnspython is still evolving.

* TSIG now defaults to using SHA-256.

* Basic type info has been added to some functions.  Future releases will
  have comprehensive type info.

* from_text() functions now have a ``relativize_to`` parameter.

* python-cryptography is now used for DNSSEC.

* Ed25519 and Ed448 signatures are now supported.

* A helper for NSEC3 generating hashes has been added.

* SHA384 DS records are supported.

* Rdatasets and RRsets are much faster.

* dns.resolver.resolve_address() has been added, allowing easy address-to-name
  lookups.

* dns.reversename functions now allow an alternate origin to be specified.

* The ``repr`` form of Rdatasets and RRsets now includes the rdata.

* A number of standard resolv.conf options are now parsed.

* The nameserver and port used to get a response are now part of the resolver's
  ``Answer`` object.

* The NINFO record is supported.

* The ``dns.hash`` module has been removed; just use Python's native
  ``hashlib`` module.

* Rounding is done in the standard python 3 fashion; dnspython 1.x rounded
  in the python 2 style on both python 2 and 3.

* The resolver will now do negative caching if a cache has been configured.

* TSIG and OPT now have rdata types.

* The class for query messages is now QueryMessage.  Class Message is now a
  base class, and is also used for messages for which we don't have a better
  class.  Update messages are now class UpdateMessage, though class Update
  is retained for compatibility.

* Support for Windows 95, 98, and ME has been removed.
